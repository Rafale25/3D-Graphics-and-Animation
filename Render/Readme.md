# The Render
[image of final render]

# Models
- Robot
- walls, ground, pillar
- wall light
- sledge hammer
- wooden box
- wooden palette
- handsaw

For the most part of the work, i did not have any idea of what i wanted the final scene to look like so i just started doing stuff.

First model i made is a four legged robot inspired by the enemies in the indie game ScrapMechanic
> insert scrapMechanic bot image

> Insert photo of the final model

The robot is more or less composed of 3 models: the body, the legs, and the arm.

I started with the body.
### process:
Circle of 6 vertices, extruded, filled the gaps.<br>
Then i used the auto-mirror to mirror the work done on one side.<br>
Then I used a square and a boolean modifier make a sphere hole for the legs joints <br>

- Modeling
    - Body
    - Arm
    - Legs
- Materials
    - shading: procedural texture
    - texture painting (edge wear)
- Rigging
    - parenting
    - constraints
    - tried inverse kinematics but couldn't get something to work well and it wasn't worse the time

## Wall light

    - emissive material

## Hand saw
- path and curves (to mesh)
- use of blueprint image

## Sledge hammer
## Wooden crate
## Wooden palette
## ground, walls, concrete pillars
